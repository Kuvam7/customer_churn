Potential Reasons for Higher Churn Rates:  

•	Income Groups:
Churn rates are higher among low-income (<$40k) and high-income ($120k+) customers. Low-income customers may leave due to financial strain, while high-income customers may feel they are not receiving enough value or benefits.  
  o	Low-Income Customers (<$40k):  
    	Offer budget-friendly plans or financial flexibility programs, such as payment extensions or rewards for consistent         usage.  
    	Provide educational resources on how to maximize card benefits without overextending finances.  

  o	High-Income Customers ($120k+): 
    	Introduce premium benefits tailored to their lifestyle, such as concierge services, exclusive travel perks, or       cashback on luxury purchases.
    	Use personalized marketing to highlight the value of staying with the service.  
    
•	Age Groups:
Customers in their early 30s, early 40s, and late 50s churn more. This could be due to significant life changes such as job transitions, family needs, or retirement planning.
o	Develop lifecycle-based retention strategies addressing life transitions. For instance: 
	Financial planning tools for early 30s and late 50s.
	Family-oriented benefits for customers in their 40s.
o	Offer personalized check-ins or recommendations during known periods of change (e.g., job transitions, pre-retirement planning).
•	Gender:
Female customers have higher churn rates compared to males. This might indicate that services or benefits are not addressing women’s specific needs or preferences.
o	Female Customers: 
	Conduct surveys to understand unmet needs and adapt services accordingly (e.g., childcare rewards, flexible spending categories).
	Highlight benefits that align with women’s priorities, such as family-friendly programs or health and wellness perks.
•	Dependents:
Customers with three dependents churn more often. This could be due to financial stress or limited time to engage with the service.
o	Customers with 3 Dependents: 
	Provide financial relief options, such as family discounts or tiered reward structures that cater to family-related expenses.
	Offer time-saving tools, like automatic bill payment setup or expense categorization for budgeting.
•	Education Levels:
Highly educated customers (postgraduates and doctorates) show higher churn. They may expect better service quality, personalized offers, or premium features.
o	Highly Educated Customers: 
	Introduce premium or exclusive features such as advanced analytics for spending trends, tailored investment offers, or superior customer service channels.
	Communicate how the card aligns with their intellectual and professional needs.
•	Card Types:
Platinum and gold cardholders have higher churn rates. These customers might feel the card benefits do not justify the costs or find better deals with competitors.
o	Platinum and Gold Cardholders: 
	Review and enhance card benefits to ensure they provide tangible value, like better travel rewards, higher cashback, or exclusive event access.
	Conduct competitor analysis and match or exceed competing offers.
•	Months on Book (Tenure):
Longer-tenured customers have higher churn. They may feel their loyalty is not being rewarded, or they may find better options elsewhere.
o	Longer-Tenured Customers: 
	Implement loyalty programs with meaningful rewards (e.g., milestone bonuses, waived fees).
	Offer tenure-based incentives, such as tiered benefits for every additional year of membership.
•	Total Relationships (Accounts):
Customers with fewer accounts or products churn more. This may indicate lower engagement or a lack of cross-sell strategies.
o	Fewer Accounts or Products: 
	Cross-sell relevant products, like savings accounts or loans, based on customer profiles.
	Bundle services at a discount to increase engagement and make switching less appealing.
•	Inactive Months (Last 12 Months):
Customers who are inactive for more than a few months are more likely to churn. This suggests a lack of ongoing engagement or declining interest.
o	Re-engage Inactive Customers: 
	Send targeted re-engagement campaigns, such as exclusive discounts or reminders of unused benefits.
	Analyze inactivity reasons and address specific pain points.
•	Complaints:
Customers with more complaints have much higher churn rates. Poor resolution of issues or dissatisfaction with service could be driving them away.
o	High Complaint Customers: 
	Establish faster complaint resolution mechanisms and track resolution satisfaction rates.
	Proactively follow up with customers who’ve recently lodged complaints to ensure resolution and satisfaction.
•	Credit Limit:
Both very high and very low credit limits lead to higher churn. Customers may feel the credit limits are either restrictive or irrelevant to their needs.
o	Very High or Very Low Limits: 
	Offer customizable credit limits based on customer spending habits and needs.
	Periodically reassess limits based on behavior to keep them aligned with customer expectations.
•	Credit Utilization:
Customers with very low or very high credit utilization are more likely to churn. Low utilization might indicate disengagement, while high utilization could reflect financial stress.
o	Very Low or Very High Utilization: 
	For low utilization: Promote benefits tied to higher usage, like increased cashback or bonus rewards.
	For high utilization: Provide financial counseling, budgeting tools, or temporary credit limit increases.
•	Average Credit Remaining:
Both high and low credit remaining on cards correlate with higher churn. This might indicate dissatisfaction with the credit policy.
o	High or Low Credit Remaining: 
	Monitor credit remaining trends and offer personalized suggestions, like balance transfers or rewards for optimized usage.
•	Spending Amount Change (Q1 to Q4):
Customers who increase their spending are less likely to churn. A decline in spending may indicate disengagement or dissatisfaction.
o	Declining Spending: 
	Identify customers with spending declines and offer incentives for increased activity, such as tiered rewards for spending.
•	Total Transaction Amount (Last Year):
Customers with lower transaction amounts churn more often. This suggests that inactive or low-spending customers feel less connected to the service.
Total Transaction Count (Last Year):
Fewer transactions correlate with higher churn. Engaged customers with frequent transactions are less likely to leave.
o	Low Spending/Transaction Volume: 
	Create engagement campaigns targeting low-activity customers, highlighting easy ways to use their cards.
	Introduce gamified challenges (e.g., “Use your card X times this month for a reward”).
•	Change in Transaction Count (Q1 to Q4):
A decrease in transaction count indicates higher churn risk. This could suggest declining interest or satisfaction.
o	Decreasing Transaction Volume: 
	Reach out with personalized messaging and suggest benefits based on their spending patterns.
•	Average Utilization Ratio:
Customers with either very low or very high utilization ratios are more likely to churn. This reflects either disengagement or financial strain.
o	Low Utilization Customers: 
	Offer rewards for higher usage or introduce promotions like increased cashback for the next X transactions.
o	High Utilization Customers: 
	Provide credit counseling and tools for managing expenses effectively.
